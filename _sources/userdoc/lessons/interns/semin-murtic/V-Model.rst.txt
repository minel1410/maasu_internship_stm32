V-Model
=======

The V-Model is a software development methodology where each stage of development is paired with a corresponding testing phase. Itâ€™s represented as a "V" shape, symbolizing how development and testing phases are connected.

   Pros
   Cons


Verification (Left Side of the V)
---------------------------------

The left side of the "V" represents the verification stages, where different design aspects are specified.

- **Requirements Analysis**: Collecting the customer requirements and determining the project needs.
- **System Design**: Defining the structure and framework of the software.
- **Architectural Design**: Planning the detailed components and their interactions.
- **Module Design**: Focusing on the design of the individual parts (modules) of the system.

Validation (Right Side of the V)
--------------------------------

The right side of the "V" represents the validation stages, where different testing phases ensure the software functions as expected.

- **Unit Testing**: Testing the smallest parts (modules) of the software individually.
- **Integration Testing**: Checking if the modules interact and work well together.
- **System Testing**: Testing the complete system to verify full functionality.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Ensuring the software meets user needs and is ready for release.

Coding (Middle of the V)
------------------------

In the middle of the V-Model is the coding phase, where code is developed according to design specifications and reviewed for issues.

Pros of the V-Model
-------------------

- **Early Problem Detection**: Testing is integrated throughout the development process.
- **Structured and Organized**: Easy to follow and keeps development on track.
- **Ideal for Safety-Critical Systems**: Suitable for projects requiring extensive planning and documentation.

Cons of the V-Model
-------------------

- **Limited Flexibility**: Difficult to make changes once development has started.
- **Not Suitable for All Projects**: Best for well-defined, large-scale projects.
- **Less Effective for Small Projects**: Not ideal for smaller, less complex projects.
- **Time-Consuming**: Requires extensive documentation, which can slow down the process.
