High-Speed Clock Sources
-------------------------

**HSI (High-Speed Internal):**

- **Description:** HSI is a high-frequency internal oscillator.
- **Frequency:** 16 MHz.
- **Accuracy:** As an RC oscillator, HSI is less precise compared to external oscillators like HSE. Nevertheless, its accuracy is sufficient for many applications.
- **Usage:** HSI is often used as a startup or backup clock source because it doesnâ€™t rely on external components and has a faster startup time. It is suitable for applications where clock precision is not critical.

**HSE (High-Speed External):**

- **Description:** HSE is a high-frequency external oscillator, typically an externally connected crystal or oscillator.
- **Frequency:** Usually between 8 and 25 MHz (25 MHz for STM32F411 Black Pill).
- **Accuracy:** Highly accurate compared to internal oscillators like HSI, providing a stable and precise frequency using an external crystal.
- **Usage:** Ideal for applications where frequency accuracy is crucial. HSE is often used with the PLL to generate higher frequencies.

Low-Speed Clock Sources
------------------------

**LSI (Low-Speed Internal):**

- **Description:** LSI is a low-frequency internal oscillator.
- **Frequency:** Approximately 32 kHz.
- **Accuracy:** As an RC oscillator, LSI has lower accuracy and stability compared to external oscillators.
- **Usage:** Mainly used as a backup clock source for the real-time clock (RTC) and for the watchdog timer, where high precision is not essential, but low power consumption is important.

**LSE (Low-Speed External):**

- **Description:** LSE is a low-frequency external oscillator, typically a 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator.
- **Frequency:** 32.768 kHz (commonly used for RTC applications).
- **Accuracy:** Very accurate and stable, thanks to the external crystal.
- **Usage:** Used for RTC applications that require long-term stability and precise timekeeping, such as in clocks or time synchronization applications.

RCC Register
------------

The RCC register is a crucial component of STM32 microcontrollers, responsible for configuring and managing the system clock and resetting peripheral devices. The RCC module allows users to:

- **Select Clock Source:** Choose between internal (HSI) and external (HSE) oscillators.
- **Configure PLL:** Generate higher frequencies from the selected clock source.
- **Use Prescalers:** Divide frequencies for various buses (AHB, APB1, APB2).
- **Manage Peripheral Clocks:** Enable or disable clock signals for peripherals to save power.

RCC_CR (Clock Control Register)
-------------------------------

The RCC register is a crucial component of STM32 microcontrollers, responsible for configuring and managing the system clock and resetting peripheral devices. The RCC module allows users to:
- Select Clock Source: Choose between internal (HSI) and external (HSE) oscillators.
- Configure PLL: Generate higher frequencies from the selected clock source.
- Use Prescalers: Divide frequencies for various buses (AHB, APB1, APB2).
- Manage Peripheral Clocks: Enable or disable clock signals for peripherals to save power.

RCC_PLLCFGR (PLL Configuration Register)
----------------------------------------

The RCC register is a crucial component of STM32 microcontrollers, responsible for configuring and managing the system clock and resetting peripheral devices. The RCC module allows users to:

Key Bits:
- SW: Selects the system clock source (00 for HSI, 01 for HSE, 10 for PLL).
- SWS: Displays the currently active system clock source.
- HPRE: Prescaler for the AHB bus.
- PPRE1: Prescaler for the APB1 bus (maximum 50 MHz).
- PPRE2: Prescaler for the APB2 bus (maximum 100 MHz).

RCC_AHB1ENR, RCC_APB1ENR, RCC_APB2ENR (Peripheral Clock Enable Registers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

These registers enable or disable the clock for peripheral devices connected to various buses (AHB1, APB1, and APB2). Setting the appropriate bit activates the functionality of a specific peripheral.

**Structure:**

- **RCC_AHB1ENR:** Used to enable peripherals on the AHB1 bus, such as GPIO ports (A-H), CRC module, DMA controllers, etc.
- **RCC_APB1ENR:** Enables peripheral devices on the APB1 bus (e.g., TIM2, TIM3, USART2, I2C1).
- **RCC_APB2ENR:** Enables peripherals on the APB2 bus (e.g., ADC1, USART1, SPI1).

SystemCoreClockUpdate() Function
--------------------------------

The `SystemCoreClockUpdate()` function is part of the CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) library used by STM32 devices for hardware abstraction.

**Functionality:**

- Updates the global `SystemCoreClock` variable, representing the current system clock frequency.
- Calculates the system clock frequency based on the settings in the RCC registers.
- Ensures accurate timing information.

Configuration of the PLL
------------------------

The PLL in the STM32F411 microcontroller is used to increase the input clock frequency to a desired higher output frequency, which drives the core, peripherals, and buses efficiently.

**Steps to Configure the PLL for 100 MHz Output:**

1. **Enable the Clock Source:**
   - Ensure the 25 MHz external oscillator (HSE) is operational.

2. **Configure PLL Registers:**
   - **PLLM (Main Prescaler):** Divides the input clock to a suitable lower frequency. For a 25 MHz input, set `PLLM = 25` to get 1 MHz.
   - **PLLN (Multiplier):** Multiplies the 1 MHz signal. To achieve 100 MHz, set `PLLN = 400`.
   - **PLLP (Output Divider):** Divides the multiplied frequency to reach the target clock. Here, set `PLLP = 4` to obtain 100 MHz.

3. **Apply Configuration:**
   - Set these values in the `RCC_PLLCFGR` register.
   - Enable the PLL using the `RCC_CR` register and wait for the PLL to lock by checking the PLL ready flag.

4. **Switch the System Clock:**
   - Once the PLL is stable, set it as the system clock source in the `RCC_CFGR` register.
