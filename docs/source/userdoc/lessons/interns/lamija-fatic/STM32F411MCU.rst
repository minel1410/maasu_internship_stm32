1. Introduction to STM32 Microcontroller Units (MCUs)
------------------------------------------------------

**Understanding Microcontroller Units (MCUs)**

A Microcontroller Unit (MCU) is a compact integrated circuit designed to manage specific operations within embedded systems. It is a small computer on a single chip that typically contains a processor, memory, and I/O peripherals. MCUs are used for tasks that require control and automation in devices like home appliances, automotive systems, and medical equipment.
Key Components of an MCU:

  1. Processor (CPU): Executes instructions and handles calculations.
  2. Memory: Includes RAM for temporary data storage and ROM/Flash for storing the program code.
  3. I/O Ports: Allow the MCU to interact with other devices or sensors, enabling real-world data processing.
MCUs are efficient for controlling and automating simple to moderately complex tasks. They consume less power, making them ideal for battery-operated devices, and can be programmed to handle tasks like monitoring sensors, managing displays, or controlling motors.
