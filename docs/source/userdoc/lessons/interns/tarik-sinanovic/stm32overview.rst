STM32 Overview
================

The STM32F411 is part of STMicroelectronics' STM32 Dynamic Efficiency™ series, offering a balance between high performance and low power consumption. It is based on the ARM Cortex-M4 core and is designed for applications requiring efficient processing and power savings, packaged in a compact 3x3 mm form.


Core and Performance
======================

- ARM Cortex-M4 core with      Floating Point Unit (FPU).
- Operates up to 100 MHz,      providing 125 DMIPS (1.25 DMIPS/MHz).
- ART Accelerator for      zero-wait-state flash execution, improving performance.
- Supports DSP instructions      for efficient signal processing.

Power Efficiency
==================

- Run mode: 100 µA/MHz (when      peripherals are off).
- Stop mode: As low as 9 µA      (typical at 25°C), with quick wake-up options.
- Standby mode: 1.8 µA      (typical at 25°C), and 1 µA when RTC is active.

Memory
========

- 512 KB Flash and 128 KB SRAM      for program and data storage.

Timers and Peripherals
========================

- Up to 11 timers, supporting      PWM, input capture, and quadrature encoder.
- DMA controller with 16      streams for efficient data transfer.

I/O and Communication
===========================

- Up to 81 I/O pins with fast      I/O speeds (up to 100 MHz).
- 3 I2C, 3 USART, 5 SPI/I2S,      USB 2.0, and SDIO interfaces.
- 5V-tolerant I/Os for broader      compatibility with external 
devices.

Analog Features
=================

- 12-bit ADC with up to 16      channels and a sampling rate of 2.4 MSPS.

Debugging and Tracing
======================

- Serial Wire Debug (SWD) and      JTAG for debugging.
- Embedded Trace Macrocell      (ETM) for real-time code tracing.

Compliance
============

- ECOPACK2 compliant, ensuring      environmentally friendly packaging.

Applications
=============

The STM32F411 is well-suited for applications such as battery-powered devices, real-time systems, and IoT devices, offering efficient power consumption and robust performance in a small package.
