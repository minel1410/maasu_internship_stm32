IR-01: General GPIO Modes
--------------------------
GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins operate in one of four modes depending on the application:
- Input mode: The pin receives digital signals from external devices such as sensors, switches, or buttons. Signals are interpreted as logical high (1) or low (0).
- Output mode: The pin sends digital signals to external devices like LEDs or motors to perform tasks such as switching or activation.
- Analog mode: The pin processes continuous analog signals for integration with ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converters) or DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converters). Applications include reading sensor data or generating analog waveforms.
- Alternate function mode: The pin interfaces with peripherals like UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter), SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), or I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit). Specialized functions such as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) or communication protocols are supported.

IR-02: Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors
--------------------------------------
Pull-up or pull-down resistors stabilize the pin state in input mode when no external signal is present, preventing undefined or floating conditions:
- A pull-up resistor ensures the default state is high (1).
- A pull-down resistor ensures the default state is low (0).
Resistors can be internal (configurable via the GPIO controller) or external (physically added to the circuit).

IR-03: Output Types
-------------------
GPIO pins support two output configurations:
- Push-pull: The pin actively drives both high (1) and low (0) states. This configuration is commonly used for general-purpose outputs.
- Open-drain: The pin actively drives only the low (0) state. A high (1) state is achieved using an external pull-up resistor. This is suitable for shared-line applications like I2C.

IR-04: Interrupt Types
----------------------
GPIO pins support hardware interrupts triggered by signal transitions:
- Rising edge: From low (0) to high (1).
- Falling edge: From high (1) to low (0).
- Both edges: Any signal transition (low-to-high or high-to-low).
Interrupts enable real-time responses to external events such as button presses or sensor triggers.

IR-05: Speed Control
--------------------
GPIO output signals support configurable speeds to meet application needs:
- Low speed: Suitable for low-frequency tasks, such as driving LEDs.
- Medium speed: Used for most general-purpose applications, balancing performance and power.
- High speed: Necessary for time-critical tasks, such as PWM or high-speed communication protocols like SPI.
Speed settings optimize power consumption, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and signal quality.
