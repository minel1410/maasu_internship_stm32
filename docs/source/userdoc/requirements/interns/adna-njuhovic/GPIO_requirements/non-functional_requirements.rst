Non-Functional Requirements
===============================

1. **Performance**:
   - **Pin State Change Speed**: The GPIO pins shall change state with a latency of no more than 1 ms when transitioning between high and low states. This includes any connected external devices, such as LEDs, reflecting the state change immediately.
   - **Interrupt Latency**: GPIO pins shall trigger interrupts within 5 ms when a state change (e.g., button press) is detected.
   - **Output Signal Latency**: The latency between setting an output signal on a GPIO pin (e.g., a high signal to control a relay) and the external device’s response (e.g., relay activation) shall not exceed 1 ms.

2. **Reliability**:
   - **Load Stability**: GPIO pins shall maintain stable operation under high-frequency operations, ensuring reliable data reading/writing even during rapid state changes.
   - **Electromagnetic Interference Resistance**: The GPIO pins shall function reliably in environments with electromagnetic interference, ensuring stable operation in the presence of high-frequency devices.
   - **Temperature Resistance**: GPIO pins shall operate within a temperature range of -40°C to +85°C, ensuring reliable performance in both industrial and outdoor environments.

3. **Usability**:
   - **Pin Configuration Simplicity**: The GPIO module shall provide a simple and intuitive API for configuring pin modes (input, output, analog, alternative function), allowing users to configure pins with minimal code. For example, configuring a pin as an input with a pull-up resistor should require only one API call.

4. **Power Consumption**:
   - **Low Power Consumption in Idle Mode**: GPIO pins shall consume minimal power when idle (e.g., in input mode with no active signals), to extend battery life in low-power applications.
   - **Low Power Optimization during Activity**: GPIO pins shall support low-power modes during inactive periods, minimizing power consumption in applications such as battery-powered sensor devices.

5. **Scalability**:
   - **Support for Additional Pins**: The GPIO module shall allow for easy expansion of the pin count without degradation in performance, requiring minimal changes to the software.
   - **Extendable Functionality**: New GPIO pins shall support all existing functionalities (input, output, PWM, ADC, etc.) without requiring significant changes to the existing software logic.

6. **Compatibility**:
   - **Platform Compatibility**: The GPIO module shall be compatible with a range of microcontrollers and development platforms, including STM32, Arduino, and ESP32.
   - **Communication Protocol Support**: The GPIO module shall support communication protocols such as UART, SPI, and I2C for interfacing with external devices and generating PWM signals.
   - **IDE and OS Compatibility**: The GPIO module’s API shall be compatible with popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), including STM32CubeIDE, Arduino IDE, and Eclipse. It shall also support integration with common operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and RTOS (Real-Time Operating System).
