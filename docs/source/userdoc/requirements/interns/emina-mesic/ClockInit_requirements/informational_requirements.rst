   **RCC Register** (Reset and Clock Control) controls clock sources and allows switching between them. It configures the PLL enableling generation of higher frequencies. The RCC Register is charge of reset control for AHB (Advanced High Performance) and APB (Advanced Peripheral) bus domains.

   **AHB** (Advanced High-Performance Bus) is a high-speed bus that connects the CPU to peripherals such as memory interfaces, DMA controllers, and interrupt controllers. It operates at the same frequency as the system clock, enabling fast data transfers and supports a single master (the processor) and multiple slaves (peripherals or memory controllers).

   **APB** (Advanced Peripheral Bus) is a low-speed bus designed for peripherals that do not require high bandwidth, such as UART, I2C, SPI, and GPIO. It operates at a divided frequency of the system clock, which is configurable via prescalers. APB1 and APB2 buses are available, where APB1 is clocked at a lower frequency (up to 50 MHz), and APB2 has a maximum frequency of 100 MHz.
